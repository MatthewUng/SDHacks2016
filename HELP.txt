2. In simple-chatbot.html change the channel to the channel you want to connect to.

3. Install an extension to allow CORS for your browser. I used one called "Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *" for google chrome.

4. Open simple-chatbot.html in your browser and it will automatically connect.


Once you have the page open, click generate to manually store user messages for the !talk command. This automatically happens every 5 minutes or when the button is clicked.
